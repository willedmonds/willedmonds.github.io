        <p>
        My name is Will Edmonds, I hail from Vancouver, BC. I'm a Sophomore at Tufts University studying Mechanical Engineering with a Computer Science minor. On campus I'm a teaching assistant for the Data Structures class, as well as a member of the ski team. Before college I took a gap year during which I travelled New Zealand solo and volunteered in Tanzania for ten weeks.
